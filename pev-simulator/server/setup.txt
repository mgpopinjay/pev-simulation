To run this, you will need:
- A google api key
- The googlemaps api python module
- geopy

Here's how:
- first install the python package installer pip if you haven't already
  On a mac this is really easy. Just open up terminal and run

    sudo easy_install pip

- Once pip is going, you can get geopy with:

    pip install geopy

  (you might have to do sudo pip install geopy)

- And you can get the googlemaps python api 

     pip install -U googlemaps

  (again, you might have to sudo it)

- Getting your google api key is described on this page:
  https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python
  and you'll want to put it in a file called 

    google_api_key

- from the repo top level folder, run gen_locs.py to scrape
  a bunch of trip start and end points from the taxi data
  so we can run good simulations. The variation of the trips
  will get better as you run more simulations
