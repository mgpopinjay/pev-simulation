        ## for each vehicle, call the statistics method over the whole time range
        ## Merge the results that each vehicle produces (mean of utilization, sum of emissions)

        ## Vehicle implementation
        ## given a time range:
        ## create a set of 30-minute buckets
        ## iterate over history
        ## for each trip in history, apply to relevant buckets
        ## utilization should be passengers or parcels * minutes of trip / bucket size
        ## emissions should be total distance of any sort. For trips that span multiple buckets,
        ## the distance should be prorated into each bucket

        ## For getting wait times:
        ## TODO: strategerize this one?
